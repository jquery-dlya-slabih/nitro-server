Server template with ton of features.

## Locking Environment Versions

It's considered good practice to lock the versions of your environment tools, such as Node.js and pnpm. To do this,
you can specify the required versions in the `engines` field in `package.json` and configure enforcement using the
`.npmrc` file in your project's root.

If needed, you can disable strict version checks by setting `engine-strict=false` in `.npmrc`.

## For dev

1. clone project `git clone https://github.com/jquery-dlya-slabih/nitro-server.git`
2. install pnpm 10.x version `npm install -g pnpm@latest-10`
3. install deps `pnpm install`
4. run dev `pnpm run dev`

## For prod

1. install deps `pnpm install`
2. pnpm build
3. pnpm prod

## Commands

| description                         | command               |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| run dev build with dev server       | `pnpm dev`            |
| run prod build                      | `pnpm build`          |
| run prod server (prod build needed) | `pnpm prod`           |
| run oxlint                          | `pnpm lint`           |
| run prettier check                  | `pnpm prettier:check` |
| run prettier write                  | `pnpm prettier:write` |

## API

API handlers are located in the `server/api` folder.

For API handlers:

- use `defineCachedEventHandler` for cached responses,
- use `defineEventHandler` for regular uncached handlers.

For more details, see the Nitro documentation:

- [api](https://nitro.build/guide#serverapi)
- [routes](https://nitro.build/guide/routing)
- [cache](https://nitro.build/guide/cache)

## Middleware

To inject middleware for APIs or routes, use the `server/middleware` directory.
See the Nitro [middleware](https://nitro.build/guide/routing#middleware) documentation for details.

## Plugins

Nitro plugins will be executed once during server startup to allow extending Nitro's runtime behavior.
They receive nitroApp context, which can be used to hook into Nitro lifecycle events.
[Plugins](https://nitro.build/guide/plugins) are auto-registered from `server/plugins` directory and run synchronously
(by order of file name) on the first Nitro initialization.

## Files

Nitro handles [assets](https://nitro.build/guide/assets) via the `server/public` directory. All assets in directory
will be automatically served. This means that you can access them directly from the browser without any special configuration.

## Cron jobs

You can define cron jobs in the `server/tasks` directory and schedule them in `nitro.config.ts`. For help configuring
schedules, check out [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) â€“ a useful tool for cron syntax.

Tasks can be executed in three ways:

- **Automatically**
- **Programmatically**
- **Manually**

Documentation [here](https://nitro.build/guide/tasks).

## Utils

You can add your application specific utils inside `server/utils` directory and they will be auto-imported when used.
Every export in the utils directory and its subdirectories will become available globally in your application. Check
[documentation](https://nitro.build/guide/utils) for more.

## Hooks

There is a `pre-push` hook in the `.githooks` folder. If you want to add another hook, for example `pre-commit`, then you need:

1. create a file with name `pre-commit` in `.githooks` folder
2. in project root use command `chmod +x .githooks/pre-commit`
3. fill new hook with any commands, like `pre-push` hook

If you want to delete all hooks:

1. remove `.githooks` folder
2. remove `prepare` command in `package.json`
3. in project root use command `git config --unset core.hooksPath`
